<p class="title">Who am I?</p>
<p>My name is Jim DeBlock, and I am an undergraduate student at the Colorado School of Mines. I am studying Computer Science, getting a Bachelor of Science degree in that, 
with a minor in Computational and Applied Mathematics. 
This website is a place where you can view some of my previous works that I've deemed good enough to show off.</p>
