<p class="center">Quick Aside</p>
<p class="center">Some of these projects were worked on in a group setting. I am not comfortable releasing them without the consent of my partners, so they will not have any code attached. Projects where I am the sole proprietor will, however, have the project/code available.</p>

<p class="center title">Minecraft Command Helper</p>
<p class="center">This project was designed in order to make the creation process in Minecraft that much easier. It makes creating commands a breeze by giving the user easy to understand fields, examples, and an explanation of the usage of commands. Currently unfinished, though workable enough to get most commands. This was programmed in Visual Basic.</p>
