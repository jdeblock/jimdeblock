<p class="title">The Project</p>
<p>The assignment for this project was to create a video game using GameMaker.</p>
<p>I worked with Mark Reifsteck and Akshit Sharma in order to create our game, Nightmare Empire.</p>

<p class="title">The Game</p>
<p>The idea for our game was to make a 2-player, rogue-like dungeon crawler game.</p>
<p>One player would control the mouse, and they were responsible for spawning enemies that the other player would fight, trying to prevent them from progressing through the levels.</p>
<p>The other player would control the keyboard. They would choose a class at the start of the game, and play through the 5 levels of the dungeon, levelling up the whole way, and try to defeat the mouse player.</p>

<p class="title">What does it look like?</p>
<p>There is a lot that went into this game, as we had to develop about 20 different abilities and 6 different enemy AIs (and a boss fight!), so it is hard to really see what this game is about using just this image, unfortunately.</p>
