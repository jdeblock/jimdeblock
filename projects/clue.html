<p class="title">The Project</p>
<p>The assignment for this project was to make a playable version of the classic boardgame, Clue using Java. I worked in a group with Graham Kitchenka and Brandon Verkamp, and we simply went forward with the project, adding in all the necessary elements as specified by the professor.</p>
<p>It plays very much like the game Clue, so I'm not going to explain it in much detail here.</p>
